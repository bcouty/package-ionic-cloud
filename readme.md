# About Ionic Cloud PHP Package

This package help you to work with Ionic Cloud Services. To use, first verify the requirements.

Actually, work only registering users in Auth Service and sending push notifications, but I'm working to add all functions of Ionic Cloud ;-)

The Auth Service of Ionic Cloud is the better way to manager device tokens and sessions of users in your Ionic mobile app. Manager the user session and all device tokens of users loggeds. Using the Auth Service, you can send Push Notifications for all devices easily!

I use this package with ***Laravel Framework*** but you can ***use with any PHP application***!

## Requirements:

- Laravel >= 5.1;
- guzzlehttp/guzzle;
- Create an account in [Ionic IO](https://apps.ionic.io/signup);
- Have an Ionic Cloud API Token (*In your ionic.io account, access your app > Settings > API Tokens*);
- Implements [Ionic Cloud features supported](https://docs.ionic.io/services/) - ([Push](https://docs.ionic.io/services/push/) or [Auth](https://docs.ionic.io/services/auth/))in your mobile app;
- For Push Notifications Service, create and configure a Profile and Certificate in Ionic IO ([for Android](https://docs.ionic.io/services/profiles/#android-fcm-project--server-key) / [for iOS](https://docs.ionic.io/services/profiles/#ios-push-certificate))
